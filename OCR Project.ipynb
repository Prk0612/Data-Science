      "1. Value Financial Markets\n",
      "We conduct ongoing research to determine our view of the financial markets’ various levels of intrinsic value relative to\n",
      "their market price today. Based on this relative valuation, we make broad decisions as to how much exposure we wish to\n",
      "have between stocks, fixed income, cash, and alternative investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Identify Expected Risk and Return\n",
      "Based on the research of our financial market valuations, we assign each underlying asset class an expected return value.\n",
      "We then measure the risk of each asset class by the long-term standard deviation for that respective benchmark.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Develop Investment Targets within Financial Plan\n",
      "Utilizing an Efficient Frontier within Modern Portfolio Theory, we begin conducting scenario analysis where we test the\n",
      "deployment of various asset classes together as one portfolio. This analysis is done alongside statistical simulations of\n",
      "returns and distribution frequencies, and utilizes the supporting data of expected return (from our intrinsic value), risk\n",

      "Investments with Callahan Financial Planning are not bank deposits, are not FDIC-insured, are not guaranteed by\n",
      "Callahan Financial Planning, nor any affiliated entities or individuals, and may go down in value.\n",
      "All investing involves risk. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Investing in securities (e.g. stocks, mutual\n",
      "funds, bonds, etc.) involves risk of loss. Different types of investments have varying degrees of risk. You should be\n",
      "prepared to bear investment loss including loss of original principal before investing.\n",
      "Because of the inherent risk of loss associated with investing, our firm is unable to represent, guarantee, or even imply\n",
      "that our services and methods of analysis can or will predict future results, successfully identify market tops or bottoms,\n",
      "or insulate you from losses due to market corrections or declines. The following list is intended to provide several\n",
      "examples of commonrisks aninvestor should always be aware of:\n",
      "\n",
      "7 Economic Risk - An investment risk associated with the overall health of the economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "7 Inflation Risk - The risk of loss of future purchasing power due to rising prices of goods and services.\n",
      "\n",
      "7 Interest Rate Risk - The possibility that the value of your investment decreases due to an increase in interest\n",
      "rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "\" Credit Risk - The possibility that a debt issuer may not be able to repay you for your investment principal or\n",
      "interest owed to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "7 Reinvestment Risk - The risk that interest or dividend payments you receive are likely to be reinvested at\n",
      "market rates that are different than at the time of purchase, and these receipts will earn a different rate of\n",
      "return than the original investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "7 Currency Exchange Risk - A form of risk that comes from the change in price of one country’s currency\n",
      "against another.\n",
      "\n",
      "7 Management Risk - Also referred to as company risk, this is the risk of owning one or only a few\n",
      "investments in specific companies. The opposite of diversification; this risk comes from management\n",
      "missteps, fraud, and competition, among other things.\n",
      "\n",
      "\" Leverage Risk - This risk comes from using debt, or margin, to fund investments. Because the debt typically\n",
      "should be repaid regardless of the performance of your investment, leverage multiplies your losses or gains\n",
      "to the extent you use it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\" Liquidity Risk - The risk that your investment cannot be converted into cash when you would like.\n",
      "\n",
      "\" Market Risk - The risk to a specific investment or portfolio that the value may decline due to general market\n",
      "conditions not specifically related to a particular company. These may include real or perceived adverse\n",
      "economic conditions now or in the future, changes in the outlook for earnings (profits), and changes in\n",
      "interest rates or currency exchange rates, among other factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our investment process is designed with an awareness of the risks listed above and others. It is impossible to eliminate all\n",
      "risks of investing, and is best viewed as a balancing act that is different for each investor. There can be no assurance of\n",
      "success in investing, and attempts at addressing risk may also be unsuccessful. Callahan Financial Planning works with\n",

      "Callahan Financial Planning, a separately identifiable division of TS Bank, is an independent investment adviser registered\n",
      "with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. You should understand that the services we provide and fees we charge\n",
      "are different than those of a broker-dealer, and that itis important to understand the difference. Tools at Investor.gov/CRS\n",
      "provide background and education about investing, broker-dealers, and investment advisers.\n",
      "What investment services and advice can you provide me?\n",
      "Callahan Financial Planning provides financial planning and investment advisory services to individuals, families, and\n",
      "institutions. For more information please see Item 7 — Types of Clients from our Form ADV Part 2A.\n",
      "Financial Planning/Consulting Services: Financial planning involves us providing initial, and often periodic or\n",
      "continuous, advice around your goals, objectives, and current situation, and we provide analysis, discussion, and\n",
      "recommendations as a planning service. The scope of one-time planning/consultation(s) is limited and not open-ended.\n",
      "Investment Management Services: This involves us managing and trading your designated account(s). We continuously\n",
      "monitor your accounts when providing these services and contact you at least annually to discuss your needs. You can\n",
      "choose whether you would like these services on a discretionary basis (where we have the authority to determine the type and\n",
      "amount of investments to be bought/sold) or a non-discretionary basis (where we have to confirm any trades with you before\n",
      "we place them). This election is made within your client agreement, and services continue in the manner selected until\n",
      "your agreement ends or you provide alternate written and accepted instructions. For more information please see Item 4\n",
      "— Advisory Business and Item 16 — Investment Discretion in our Form ADV Part 2A.\n",
      "We can recommend any product that may be suitable relative to your specific circumstances and needs. We do not\n",
      "provide advice on proprietary products, except when a custodian is currently inalterable (e.g., by a 401k provider). When\n",
      "providing investment management services, we generally require at least $500,000 in investments. This may be waived in\n",

      "for consulting is $250. We also provide planning under a fixed fee arrangement. The minimum fixed fee is $250, and the\n",
      "maximum annual fixed fee is generally $25,000. The default billing frequency for fixed fees is quarterly.\n",
      "Asset Management Fees: Fees for our management service are charged based on a percentage of assets managed, with the\n",
      "default billing in advance on a quarterly calendar basis, and calculated based on the fair market value of your account as of\n",
      "the last business day of the previous billing period. As our fee is based on the value of your account, we have an incentive\n",
      "to encourage that you increase the assets in the account.\n",
      "Other Fees & Expenses: When engaging us for asset management services, investors will also incur other fees and expenses.\n",
      "The broker-dealer/custodian on your account may charge you transaction fees for executing trades in your account.\n",
      "Investors are also charged management fees by the funds we invest in.\n",
